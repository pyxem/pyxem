            There appears to be some python code in ${{ github.sha }} that is not formatted according
            to the [psf/black](https://github.com/psf/black) specification. This pull request
            formats the code in question and is inline with the
            [pyxem developers guide](https://pyxem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#code-style)
          base: ${{ github.head_ref }} # Creates pull request onto pull request or commit branch
