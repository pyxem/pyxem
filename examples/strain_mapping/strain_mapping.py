Strain Mapping
==============

Strain mapping in pyxem is done by fitting a :class:`~.signals.tensor_field.DisplacementGradientMap` to the data.
This can be thought of as image distortion around some central point.

.. note::
    This example may be skipped during automated documentation builds to speed up the 
    build process. To run all examples locally, unset the PYXEM_SKIP_SLOW_EXAMPLES 
    environment variable.

# %%
# In this example we will create a simulated strain map using the :meth:`~.data.simulated_strain` function.
# This just creates a simulated diffraction pattern and applies a simple "strain" to it. In this
# case using simulated data is slightly easier for demonstration purposes. If you want to use
# real data the :meth:`~.data.zrnb_precipitate` dataset is a good example of strain from a precipitate.

# using the :meth:`~.signals.diffraction2d.get_diffraction_vectors` method

# Plotting the template matched signal and setting ``vmin`` is a good way to see what threshold you
# should use for the :meth:`~.signals.diffraction2d.get_diffraction_vectors` method.

# Determining the Strain
# ----------------------
# We can just use the first ring of the diffraction pattern to determine the strain. We can do this by
# using the :meth:`~.signals.DiffractionVectors.filter_magnitude` method. You can also look at the
# :ref:`filtering vectors <_sphx_glr_examples_vectors_masking_vectors.py>` example to see
# how to select which vectors you want to use more generally. You can also just manually input the un-strained
# vectors or use simulated/ rotated vectors as well.

    min_magnitude=0.1,
    max_magnitude=1,
)
unstrained_vectors = first_ring_vectors.inav[0, 0]

strain_maps = first_ring_vectors.get_strain_maps(
    unstrained_vectors=unstrained_vectors, return_residuals=False
)

# %%
# Some final notes about strain mapping. In general, you want to use as many pixels as possible. 512 x 512 is a good
# place to start.  You can do strain mapping with fewer pixels, but the results will be less accurate. Precession
# also helps improve the results as does having a thinner sample both of which reduce the effects of dynamical
# diffraction.
