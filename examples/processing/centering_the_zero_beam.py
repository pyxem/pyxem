# Getting the Position of the Zero beam
# -------------------------------------
# The zero beam position can be obtained using the :meth:`get_direct_beam_position` method.

# Visualize the Zero Beam Position
# --------------------------------
# To visualize the zero beam position, we can plot the beam position on the original signal.

# %%
# Getting a Linear Plane
# ----------------------
# In many instances the zero beam position will vary systematically with the scan position.
# This can be corrected by fitting a linear plane to the zero beam position using the
# :meth:`get_linear_plane` method.
s_linear_plane = s_shifts.get_linear_plane()

# %%
# Centering the Zero Beam
# -----------------------
# The zero beam can be centered using the :meth:`center_direct_beam` method.
# Then we sum all the diffraction patterns for the both the centered beam,
# and the non-centered one, to compare them.

# %%
# Centering the Zero Beam with constant deflection magnitude
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# In the presence of electromagnetic fields in the entire sample area,
# the plane fitting can fail. In this case, two separate effects can be observed:
#
# 1. The zero beam position varies systematically with the scan position due to the effects of descan
# 2. The zero beam will be deflected from electromagnetic fields in the sample
#
# Assuming that the effects of 1 are systematic and that the electromagnetic fields have
# constant strengths, we can try to fit a plane to correct for effects of 1 by minimizing the
# magnitude variance. You may need use a mask and/or have several electromagnetic
# domains for good performance.

s_probes = pxm.data.simulated_constant_shift_magnitude()

s_shifts = s_probes.get_direct_beam_position(method="center_of_mass")

# %%
# Getting the Linear Plane
# ------------------------
# We call `get_linear_plane` with `constrain_magnitude_variance=True`. Then
# we can center the direct beam as normal.
s_shifts.plot(suptitle="Before Constrained Linear Plane Fit")
s_linear_plane = s_shifts.get_linear_plane(constrain_magnitude_variance=True)
s_linear_plane.plot(suptitle="After Constrained Linear Plane Fit")

s_probes.center_direct_beam(shifts=s_linear_plane)

# %%
# Getting the Electromagnetic Domains
# -----------------------------------
# The found electromagnetic domains can be visualized by subtracting the linear plane from the original shifts.
# This is done by subtracting the linear plane determined from the constrained magnitude variance
# from the original shifts.
s_shifts -= s_linear_plane
s_shifts.get_magnitude_phase_signal().plot()

# For more realistic data, the linear plane optimization algorithm can give poor results. In this case,
# you can change the initial values for the optimization algorithm by using the `initial_values` parameter
# in `get_linear_plane`. See the docstring for more information. Try varying this and see if the plane
# changes significantly.
