Azimuthal Integration (in Pyxem!)
=================================

pyxem now includes built in azimuthal integration functionality. This is useful for
extracting radial profiles from diffraction patterns in 1 or 2 dimensions.  The new method
will split the pixels into radial bins and then sum the intensity in each bin resulting in
a `Diffraction1D` or `Polar2D` signal.  In each case the total intensity of the diffraction
pattern is preserved.

.. note::
    This example may be skipped during automated documentation builds to speed up the 
    build process. To run all examples locally, unset the PYXEM_SKIP_SLOW_EXAMPLES 
    environment variable.

# Aside: Actual Implementation
# Here we have plotted the polygon bins which we use to integrate.  For each
# bin, the pixel indicies contained are saved to an array along side the fraction
# of each pixel within the bin.  Then for each diffraction pattern the fraction of
# each pixel within the bin is mutiplied, then summed to "integrate" the intensity
# for each radial bin.

# There are also other things you can account for with azimuthal integration, such as the
# effects of the Ewald sphere.  This can be done by calibrating with a known detector distance,
# and beam energy. In most cases the Flat Ewald sphere assumption is good enough but occasionally,
# you might want some additional Accuracy.
#
# Here we just show the effect of just calibrating with the first peak vs. calibrating
# with the known beam energy and detector distance. For things like accurate template matching good
# calibration can be important when matching to high diffraction vectors. The calibration example gives
# more information on how to get the correct values for your microscope/setup.
#
# If you are doing x-ray diffraction please raise an issue on the pyxem github to let us know! The same
# assumptions should apply for each case, but it would be good to test!

# We only show the 1D case here, but the same applies for the 2D case as well!
