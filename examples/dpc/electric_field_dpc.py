Electric Field Mapping
======================

When we measure a change in the position of the electron beam on the camera, we are directly measuring
that the electron beam has been deflected from the optic axis. In other words, the momentum of the electron
beam in the xy plane has changed. Since electrons are charged particles, we can relate the electronâ€™s momentum
change to an electric field using the Lorentz force equation.

.. math::

    \\frac{dp}{dt} = qE + \\nu X B

This can be also expressed as:

.. math::

    \\frac{m_0 \\gamma | \\nu |^2 \\theta}{et} \\approx E_{xy}

or solving for the electric field in the y (or x) direction:

.. math::

    \\frac{m_0 \\gamma | \\nu |^2 \\theta_y}{et} \\approx E_{y}

Where :math:`m_0` is the rest mass of the electron,
:math:`\\gamma` is the Lorentz factor,
:math:`| \\nu |` is the speed of the electron,
:math:`e` is the elementary charge, and :math:`t` is the thickness of
the sample and :math:`\\theta_y` is the deflection angle in the y direction.

# The shifts are new in units of mV/m, which is a common unit for electric fields.

# Finding a Profile
# =================
# Now we can make a nice profile of the electric field using a line profile. Let's make this interactive using
# a hyperspy ROI widgets. This should work best with the ``qt`` backend, although the ``ipympl`` backend
# should also work (hopefully). We could do this not interactively but this is a  fun example of how to use
# hyperspy's interactive tools.
