Simulating electron diffraction
===============================

Electron diffraction simulations are made available through PyCrystEM.

Ultimately multiple simulation tools will be made available covering various
applications but at present only the simplest methods are implemented. All
methods are available through the ElectronDiffractionGenerator class.

Kinematical simulation of spot patterns
=======================================

Kinematical simulation of spot diffraction patterns is implemented as described
in numerous textbooks.
