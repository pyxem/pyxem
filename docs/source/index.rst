Welcome to PyCrystEM's documentation!
=====================================

PyCrystEM (Python Crystallographic Electron Microscopy) is an open-source Python
library for crystallographic electron microscopy.

PyCrystEM builds on the tools for multi-dimensional data analysis provided by
the HyperSpy library for treatment of experimental electron diffraction data and
tools for atomic structure manipulation provided by the PyMatGen library.

PyCrystEM is released under the GPL v3 license.

This version is currently under construction.
