pyXem is an open-source Python library for crystallographic electron microscopy.
The code is primarily developed as a platform for hybrid diffraction-imaging
microscopy based on scanning (precession) electron diffraction (S(P)ED) data.
This approach may be illustrated schematically, as follows:

pyXem builds heavily on the tools for multi-dimensional data analysis provided
by the `HyperSpy <http://hyperspy.org>`__ library and draws on `DiffPy <http://diffpy.org>`__ 
for atomic structure manipulation.

pyXem is released under the GPL v3 license.

Tutorial notebooks are available `here <https://github.com/pyxem/pyxem-demos>`__.

.. warning::

    The pyXem project is in early stages of development and there will be bugs.
    All methods must be used with care. The developers take no responsibility for
    inappropriate application of the code or incorrect conclusions drawn as a result. 
    We hope that by releasing the code at this stage the community can move forward more quickly.
