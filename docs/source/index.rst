pyXem - Pythonic Crystallographic Electron Microscopy
=====================================================

pyXem is an open-source Python library for crystallographic electron microscopy.
The code is primarily developed as a platform for hybrid diffraction-imaging
microscopy based on scanning (precession) electron diffraction (S(P)ED) data.
This approach may be illustrated schematically, as follows:

pyXem builds heavily on the tools for multi-dimensional data analysis provided
by the `HyperSpy <http://hyperspy.org>`__ library and draws on `DiffPy <http://diffpy.org>`__ 
for atomic structure manipulation.

pyXem is released under the GPL v3 license.

Tutorial notebooks are available `here <https://github.com/pyxem/pyxem-demos>`__.

.. warning::

    The pyXem project is in early stages of development and there will be bugs.
    Many methods must be used with care and could be improved significantly. The
    developers take no responsibility for inappropriate application of the code
    or incorrect conclusions drawn as a result of their application. Users must
    take responsibility for ensuring results obtained are sensible. We hope that
    by releasing the code at this stage the community can move forward more quickly
    together.
