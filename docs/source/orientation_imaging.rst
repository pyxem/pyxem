Orientation Imaging
===================

Orientation imaging can be achieved in a number of ways based on the acquisition
of numerous electron diffraction patterns in the scanning transmission
electron microscope. A range of analysis procedures implemented to this end as
described in this section.


Template Matching
=================

Template matching involves comparing each diffraction pattern in the dataset to
a library of simulated template patterns and determining the optimal fit at each
pixel.

A library of template patterns is first generated using the ElectronDiffractionGenerator


Direct Indexation
=================

Direct indexation proceeds by determining the g-vectors recorded in each
diffraction pattern and
