Version 1.0.0
===========================
Removed
-------
- Removed Dependency on pyfai.  Azimuthal integration is all handled internally (#1103)
- Removed Generator classes that were deprecated (#1102)
    - Removed IndexationGenerator, CalibrationGenerator, VirtualImageGenerator,
      SubpixelRefinementGenerator, VarianceGenerator, PDFGenerator1D, and VirtualDarkFieldGenerator


2024-06-10 - version 0.19.1
===========================
Fixed
-----
- Fixed bugs releated to orientation mapping with multiple phases and the plotting of the
  vector annotations. (#1090)

2024-06-08 - version 0.19.0
===========================

Restructuring of DPC processing
-------------------------------
- Total restructure of data processing of DPC data. This has now all been moved to the :class:`pyxem.signals.BeamShift` class.
- `DPCBaseSignal`, `DPCSignal1D`, `DPCSignal2D`, `LazyDPCBaseSignal`, `LazyDPCSignal1D`, `LazyDPCSignal2D` has been deprecated.
- `Diffraction2D.center_of_mass` has been deprecated. The functionality now resides in :meth:`pyxem.signals.Diffraction2D.get_center_beam_position`. Use `get_center_beam_position(method="center_of_mass")`
- Several `dummy_data` functions has been renamed to reflect this change: `dpc_signal` to `beam_shift_signal`
- `get_color_image_with_indicator` has been renamed and moved, :func:`pyxem.utils.plotting.plot_beam_shift_color`
- `correct_ramp` has been deprecated, with the functionality now residing in :meth:`pyxem.signals.BeamShift.get_linear_plane`. You can use `s_bs_lp = s_bs.get_linear_plane(fit_corners=0.05)`, then `s_bs -= s_bs_lp` to correct for the dscan shifts
- `:meth:`pyxem.signals.BeamShift.make_linear_plane` is being deprecated, and replaced with `:meth:`pyxem.signals.BeamShift.get_linear_plane`. It now returns a new signal, instead of altering the old one.
- `gaussian_blur` and `flip_axis_90_degrees` has been deprecated, as this can easily be done using `s.map`
