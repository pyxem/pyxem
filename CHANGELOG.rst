2022-15-06 - version 0.14.2
===========================

Changed
-------
- Increase minimal version of orix to >= 0.9.
- Increase minimal version of diffsims to >= 0.5.

Fixed
-----
- Fix bug in `get_DisplacementGradientMap` (#852)
- Fix template matching bugs (originally fixed in #771 but omitted from 0.14 series by accident)

2022-29-04 - version 0.14.1
===========================

Added
-----
- Getting and plot integrated intensity now support signals containing nan (#722)
- Add Symmetry1D signal class and symmetry analysis methods (#724)
- BeamShift class, which includes the `make_linear_plane` method for better correction of the beam shift when scanning large regions in STEM (#746)
- Add unit testing of docstring examples (#766)
- Add function for optimizing calibration of SPED data (#785)
- Add function for creating a orix CrystalMap from indexation results (#794)
- Speed optimizations for the fast template matching on CPU and GPU, improving speeds by 200% and 40% respectively (#796)
- Added the ability to determine the center and ellipticity using the `determine_ellipse` function.

Removed
-------
- lazy_* virtual imaging has been removed, use get_integrated_intensity (#722)
- `big_data_utils` has been removed as this is not the modern way of attacking this problem
- similarly, `TemplateIndexationGenerator` has been removed as the Accelerated approach is far better (#823)
Fixed
^^^^^
- Symmetry STEM Class updated to allow for better interpolation and lazy operation. (#809)
- Generalized plotting diffraction vectors on ND stacks of images (#783)
- Small bugfix with dask/cuda scheduler to prevent running out of VRAM (#779)
- Bugfix:AzimuthalIntegral1D accepts masks and uses updated `map` function (#826)

Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^
- The `lazy_result` keyword, which has been changed to `lazy_output` to conform to similar keyword in HyperSpy

Changed
^^^^^^^
- For developers: HyperSpy's `.map` function will now be used to process big datasets, instead of pyXem's `process_dask_array`

2021-04-14 - version 0.13.2
===========================

Added
-----
- Code now support python 3.9
- Code now runs on hyperspy 1.6.2

Fixed
-----
- np.bool replaced by bool
- np.object replaced by object

2021-03-21 - version 0.13.1
===========================

Fixed
-----
- load_mib (#734)
- correct_bad_pixels now returns the same result when lazy/not-lazy (bug #723, fix #735)
- mirrored templates now correctly dealt with in radial template matching (#740)
- further bugfixes for AcceleratedIndexationGenerator (#744)
- a k-space error effecting azimuthal integration (#738)
- bug in .to_crystal_map()

Deprecated
----------
- lazy_virtual_bright_field, use get_integrated_intensity instead
- lazy_virtual_dark_field, use get_integrated_intensity instead

2021-01-13 - version 0.13.0
===========================

Added
-----
- Faster rotation indexing, using in plane speeds up, added as AcceleratedIndexationGenerator (#673)
- get_direct_beam_position now supports lazy processing (#648)
- center_direct_beam now supports lazy processing (#658)
- Several functions for processing large datasets using dask (#648, #658)
- Methods to retrieve phase from DPC signal are added (#662)
- Add VirtualImageGenerator.set_ROI_mesh method to set mesh of CircleROI (#700)
- Added a setup.cfg

Changed
-------
- The importing of pyxem objects has been standardized (#704)
- get_direct_beam_position now has reversed order of the shifts [y, x] to [x, y] (#653)
- .apply_affine_transform now uses a default order of 1 (changed from 3)
- find_peaks is now provided by hyperspy, method 'xc' now called 'template_matching'
- virtual_annular_dark_field and virtual_bright_field renamed; now have a `lazy\_` prefixing (#698)
- Plotting large, lazy, datasets will be much faster now (#655)
- Calibration workflow has been altered (see PR #640 for details)
- Azimuthal integration has been refactored (see PRs #625,#676 for details)

Removed
-------
