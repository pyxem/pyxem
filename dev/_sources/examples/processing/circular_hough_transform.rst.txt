Circular Hough Transform Peak Finding
=====================================

The Circular Hough Transform is a method to detect circular features in an image. It can be
used to detect rings (or disks) in the diffraction pattern.  For strain mapping there is
some evidence that the Circular Hough transform is more accurate than typical template matching
and can provide subpixel accuracy.

That being said, the Windowed Template Matching that pyxem uses is quite robust, (both to noise
and in homogeniety in the diffraction disks) although a complete comparison hasn't been fully
studied.

Canny Filter
---------------------
First we have to apply a Canny filter to the dataset to get a binary image of the
outlines of the disks.  This is basically a 1st diriviative in reciporical space

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 31-43

.. code-block:: Python


    # Filter the image with a Canny filter.
    canny_img = s.map(
        canny,
        sigma=2,
        low_threshold=0.6,
        high_threshold=0.8,
        inplace=False,
        use_quantiles=True,
    )

    canny_img.plot()  # Plotting canny filtered image with outlines

Computing the Hough Transform
-----------------------------
We can then compute the hough Transform using the radius of the disk. It is possible to
have multiple radii but that will return multiple signals for each radii

Finding Peaks
-------------
Finding peaks is fairly easy from this point and uses the ``get_diffraction_vectors`` function.
