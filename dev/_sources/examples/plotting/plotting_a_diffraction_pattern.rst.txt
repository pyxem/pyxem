Plotting a Diffraction Pattern
==============================

This is sometimes not as straightforward as it seems because you might have a zero
beam that is too bright and regions of the diffraction pattern that are too dark.

    mulit_phase = fe_multi_phase_grains()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 14-17

We can plot easily using the `plot` method. This will show the diffraction pattern
but the plot is static and not interactive. Additionally, the zero beam is too bright
and the high k values are too dark.

Plotting the diffraction pattern with a logarithmic scale can help to see the high k values
But because most of the values are zero, the contrast is not great and is too stretched.

You can also use the `symlog` norm to plot the diffraction pattern with a logarithmic scale
but with a linear scale around zero. This can be useful to see the zero beam and the high k values.
additionally you can visualize negative and positive values as well.

We can also set vmin and vmax to control the contrast. This can be useful to see the high k values.
A very useful feature is the ability to plot the diffraction pattern with vmax set to the 99th percentile.
This sets the maximum value to the 99th percentile of the data. In general this works better than setting
norm='log' if you have zero values in the diffraction pattern.

Note: that any of the plots are interactive if you add:
%matplotlib ipympl or %matplotlib qt at the beginning of a Jupyter notebook cell.
%matplotlib inline will make the plots static.
