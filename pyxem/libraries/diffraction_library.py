    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        The location of the file to be loaded
    safety : bool (defaults to False)
        Unpickling is risky, this variable requires you to acknowledge those risks

    Finds an element that is 'basically' the same as the rotation asked for.

    Parameters
    ----------
    library : DiffractionLibrary
        The library to be searched
    phase : str
        The phase to be searched
    angle : tuple
        The target angle, in the same format as the library angle keys

    Returns
    -------
    dict

    Notes
    -----
    This is needed because of floating point round off/hashability.
    'basically' in this context means to within 1e-5
    If more than one angle satisfies this criterion a random solution is returned
