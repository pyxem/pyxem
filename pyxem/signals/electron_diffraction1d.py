        Creates a model for fitting diffraction peaks for a ring pattern using a series of Gaussians.

        This is primarily useful for calibration but could be potentially used for other things like
        phase segmentation from 1D diffraction patterns.  The lack of a parallel option for model fitting
        in hyperspy limits that usefulness for 4D STEM.  If that is something you are interested in doing,
        raise an issue for more discussion.

        Parameters
        ----------
        simulation : diffsims.simulations.Simulation1D
            The simulation of a 1D "powder" diffraction pattern.
        power_law_background : bool
            Whether to include a power law background in the model.
        starting_scale : float
            The starting scale for the model.  If None, the maximum peak intensity in the simulation is used.
            Note that removing the zero peak is generally a good idea to help with fitting.
        auto_limit_peaks : bool
            Whether to automatically guess some reasonable parameters for the Gaussian peaks and bounds.
        fit : bool
            Whether to fit the model.  If False, the model is returned unfitted.

        Returns
        -------
        model : hyperspy.models.Model1D
            The model for fitting the diffraction peaks to a 1D diffraction pattern.

        This functionality is still under development and may change slightly in the future.
