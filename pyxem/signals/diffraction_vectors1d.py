    """A Collection of Diffraction Vectors with a defined 1D set of vectors.

    For every navigation position there is specifically one vector that represents

    Examples of DiffractionVectors1D Signals:
        - STEM_DPC

        - Diffraction shifts/ Centers

    Attributes
    ----------
    column_scale : np.array()
        The scale for each column in the signal.  For converting the real values
        to pixel values in some image.

    column_offsets : np.array()
        The offsets for each column in the signal.  For converting the real values
        to pixel values in some image.
