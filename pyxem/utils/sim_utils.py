    Parameters
    ----------
    diffsim : diffsims.DiffractionSimulation
        A DiffractionSimulation object
    size : int
        Side length (in pixels) for the signal to be simulated.

        Standard deviation of the Gaussian function to be plotted.

        Half the side length in reciprocal Angstroms. Defines the signal's
        calibration

    -------
    dp : ElectronDiffraction
        Simulated electron diffraction pattern.
