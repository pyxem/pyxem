def correlate(image, pattern_dictionary):
    """The correlation between a diffraction pattern and a simulation.

    Calculated using

    .. math::

        \\frac{\sum_{j=1}^m P(x_j, y_j) T(x_j, y_j)}{\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^m T^2(x_j, y_j)}}
    
    for T a template and P an experimental pattern
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    image : :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        A single electron diffraction signal. Should be appropriately scaled
        and centered.
    pattern_dictrionary : dict
        Containing:
            :class:`pyxem.DiffractionSimulation`
            The calibrated coords as 'pixel_coords',masked correctly
            The intensities as 'intensities', masked correctly
    Returns
    -------
    float
        A coefficient of correlation, unnormalised. This is in contrast to the
        reference work.
