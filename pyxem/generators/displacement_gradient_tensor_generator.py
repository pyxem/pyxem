def get_DisplacementGradientMap(
    strained_vectors, unstrained_vectors, weights=None, return_residuals=False, **kwargs
):
    r"""Calculates the displacement gradient tensor at each navigation position in a map.

    Compares vectors to determine the 2 x 2 matrix,
    :math:`\\mathbf(L)`, that maps unstrained vectors, Vu, to strained vectors,
    Vs, using the np.lingalg.inv() function to find L that satisfies
    :math:`Vs = \\mathbf(L) Vu`.

    The transformation is returned as a 3 x 3 displacement gradient tensor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    strained_vectors : hyperspy.Signal2D
        Signal2D with a 2 x n array at each navigation position containing the
        Cartesian components of two strained basis vectors, V and U, defined as
        row vectors.
    unstrained_vectors : numpy.array
        A 2 x n array containing the Cartesian components of two unstrained
        basis vectors, V and U, defined as row vectors.
    weights : list
        of weights to be passed to the least squares optimiser, not used for n=2
    return_residuals: Bool
        If the residuals for the least squares optimiser should be returned.
    kwargs: dict
        Any additional keyword arguments passed to the `hyperspy.signals.BaseSignal.map`
        function.

    Returns
    -------
    D : DisplacementGradientMap
        The 3 x 3 displacement gradient tensor (measured in reciprocal space) at
        every navigation position.

    Notes
    -----
    n=2 now behaves the same as the n>2 case; see Release Notes for 0.10.0 for details.
