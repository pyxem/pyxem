Generating DisplacementGradientMaps from diffraction vectors

    Calculates the displacement gradient by comparing vectors with linear algebra

    Parameters
    ----------
    strained_vectors : Signal2D

    unstrained_vectors : numpy.array with shape (2,2)
        For two vectors: V and U measured in x and y the components should fill the array as

    Returns
    -------
    D : DisplacementGradientMap
        The 3x3 displacement gradient tensor (measured in reciprocal space)
        at every navigation position

    Calculates the displacement gradient tensor by relating two pairs of vectors

    Parameters
    ----------

    -----
    This routine is based on the equation
