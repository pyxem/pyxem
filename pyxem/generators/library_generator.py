            to be simulated.

        calibration : float
            The calibration of experimental data to be correlated with the
            library, in reciprocal Angstroms per pixel.

        reciprocal_radius : float
            The maximum g-vector magnitude to be included in the simulations.

        representation : 'euler' or 'axis-angle'
            The representation in which the orientations are provided.
            If 'euler' the zxz convention is taken and values are in radians, if
            'axis-angle' the rotational angle is in degrees.

        half_shape: tuple
