    """Computes electron diffraction patterns for a crystal structure.

    1. Calculate reciprocal lattice of structure. Find all reciprocal points
       within the limiting sphere given by :math:`\\frac{2}{\\lambda}`.

    2. For each reciprocal point :math:`\\mathbf{g_{hkl}}` corresponding to
       lattice plane :math:`(hkl)`, compute the Bragg condition
       :math:`\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{\\lambda}{2d_{hkl}}`

    3. The intensity of each reflection is then given in the kinematic
       approximation as the modulus square of the structure factor.
