pyXem is an open-source python library for crystallographic diffraction microscopy.

The package defines objects and functions for the analysis of numerous diffraction patterns and has been primarily developed as a platform for hybrid diffraction-microscopy based on 4D scanning diffraction microscopy data in which a 2D diffraction pattern is recorded at every position in a 2D scan of a specimen.

**Installation instructions, documentation and tutorial examples are available** `here <https://pyxem.github.io/pyxem-website>`__ .

If analysis using pyXem forms a part of published work please cite the DOI at the top of this page.

pyXem is released under the GPL v3 license.
