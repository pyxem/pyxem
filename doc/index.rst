=================================
Welcome to pyxem's documentation!
=================================

Pyxem is an open source project working to bring together tools for the analysis of
data from pixelated electron detectors. Based on the HyperSpy project, pyxem has an
active community of users and developers who are interested in many different areas
including:

- Orientation Mapping of Crystals
- Strain Mapping
- Virtual Dark Field Imaging
- Differential Phase Contrast
- Structural Characterization of Amorphous Materials
- And much, much more!

Where do I start?
=================

For most cases starting with one of the linked Jupyter notebooks is the correct place to
start. If you can either download the notebook and run locally or run the notebooks
remotely using Binder.

If you are searching for documentation on some function you can use the API reference or
search the documentation.

The following notebooks should provide workflows for analyzing your dataset.
