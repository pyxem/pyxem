Welcome to pyxem's documentation!
=================================
Pyxem is an open source project working to bring together tools for the analysis of
data from pixilated electron detectors.  Based on the Hyperspy project, pyxem has an active
community of users and developers who are interested in many different areas including:

- Orientation Mapping of Crystals
- Strain Mapping
- Virtual Dark Field Imaging
- Differential Phase Contrast
- Structural Characterization of Amorphous Materials
- And much, much more!

Where do I start?
------------------
For most cases starting with one of the linked jupyter notebooks is the
correct place to start. If you can either download the notebook and run locally
or run the notebooks remotely using Binder.

Otherwise is you are searching for documentation on some function
then you can use the API reference or search the documentation.

The following Jupyter Notebooks should give you good workflows for analyzing your dataset.
