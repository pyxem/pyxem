Open datasets and workflows
===========================

Here are some open datasets which are helpful for running some of the functions using real data:

#. `Data <https://drive.google.com/open?id=11CV7_wkFIsOtDICOcil8Bo25fo0NlR9I>`_ for the demo notebooks.

#. A curated list of electron microscopy data https://emdb.msae.wisc.edu/emdb/.

#. 4D-STEM atomic resolution dataset of a perovskite oxide thin film: https://zenodo.org/record/4727847/files/011_big_film_512x512_updated.hspy?download=1.

#. Magnetic STEM-DPC dataset: https://zenodo.org/record/4312960.

#. Cu-Ag nano-crystalline alloy PED dataset:  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5595292. Used in the `orientation mapping paper <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2022.113517>`_.

#. Austenitic steel with radiation induced embedded precipitates NBED dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5597738. Used in the `orientation mapping paper <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2022.113517>`_.
