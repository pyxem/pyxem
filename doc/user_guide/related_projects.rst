In the HyperSpy ecosystem
-------------------------

- `HyperSpy <https://hyperspy.org>`_: Python library with tools for multi-dimensional
  data analysis, which pyxem builds upon.
- `kikuchipy <https://kikuchipy.org>`_: Python library for analysis and processing of
  electron backscatter diffraction patterns, in the pyxem family.
- `orix <https://github.com/pyxem/orix>`_: Python library for handling crystal
  orientation mapping data, in the pyxem family.
- `diffsims <https://github.com/pyxem/diffsims>`_: Python library for simulating
  diffraction, in the pyxem family.
- `pixstem <https://pixstem.org/>`_: Python library for pixelated STEM. Merged with
  pyxem, but its documentation is still a great reference.
