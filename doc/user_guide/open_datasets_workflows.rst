Open datasets and workflows
===========================

Here are some open datasets which are helpful for running some of the functions using real data:

#. The :mod:`pyxem.data` module included pyxem will either download data from
   the `zenodo <https://zenodo.org/records/11284654>`_ repo or create dummy datasets on the fly.

#. 4D-STEM atomic resolution dataset of a perovskite oxide thin film: https://zenodo.org/record/4727847/files/011_big_film_512x512_updated.hspy.

#. Magnetic STEM-DPC dataset: https://zenodo.org/record/4312960.

#. Cu-Ag nano-crystalline alloy PED dataset:  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5595292. Used in the `orientation mapping paper <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2022.113517>`_.

#. Austenitic steel with radiation induced embedded precipitates NBED dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5597738. Used in the `orientation mapping paper <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2022.113517>`_.


Here are links to open analysis workflows, not included in the
:ref:`Tutorials`, demonstrating the functionality of Pyxem:

#. Analysis workflows associated with the `orientation mapping paper <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2022.113517>`_: https://github.com/din14970/pyxem_template_matching_workflows/tree/v2.

precipitates in aluminium alloys https://github.com/elisathr/SPED-phase-mapping
