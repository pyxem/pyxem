@article{Zhang:16,
abstract = {The elastic and inelastic mean free paths of three metallic glass alloys, Ni60Nb40, Pd82Si18 and Ni80P20, have been measured from focused ion beam prepared thin samples with measured thickness gradients. The elastic/inelastic mean free paths of the three alloys are 35±0.5/97±3, 26±0.5/148±3 and 40±0.5/129±2.5 nm, respectively. Elastic mean free paths predicted from atomic scattering cross sections consistently underestimate the experimental data. A model based on the Wentzel atomic model was developed and the fit to available data is in much better agreement with experiments, with a maximum deviation of $\sim$4 nm. The parametrized model is thus capable of predicting the elastic mean free path for other amorphous materials. Existing models for the inelastic mean free path are not in good agreement with the experimental data.},

@article{Pekin:17,
abstract = {Scanning nanobeam electron diffraction strain mapping is a technique by which the positions of diffracted disks sampled at the nanoscale over a crystalline sample can be used to reconstruct a strain map over a large area. However, it is important that the disk positions are measured accurately, as their positions relative to a reference are directly used to calculate strain. In this study, we compare several correlation methods using both simulated and experimental data in order to directly probe susceptibility to measurement error due to non-uniform diffracted disk illumination structure. We found that prefiltering the diffraction patterns with a Sobel filter before performing cross correlation or performing a square-root magnitude weighted phase correlation returned the best results when inner disk structure was present. We have tested these methods both on simulated datasets, and experimental data from unstrained silicon as well as a twin grain boundary in 304 stainless steel.},

In order to retrieve good quality and artifact-free phase images for quantitative analysis and image processing, particular emphasis is put on the algorithm for proper phase retrieval. Examples of application are discussed that demonstrate the functionality of the method even in cases where the one-dimensional phase integration fails completely.},
